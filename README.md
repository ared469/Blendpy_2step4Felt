# Blendpy_2step4Felt
A Felt material created a little faster with two scripts. The first to edit the shader material, needs to have the color ramp connected to the grey circle instead of the yellow, and the color ramp needs to be edited slightly to have the black and white closer together in the middle-ish area. Once that's sorted you can run the second script.

Had to do a few edits, for example I had to tick B-Spline and then play around with the children part on the particles to create the best felt-like look i wanted but still faster with this.
