# Blendpy_2step4Felt
A Felt material created a little faster with two scripts. The first to edit the shader material, needs to have the color ramp connected to the grey circle instead of the yellow, and the color ramp needs to be edited slightly to have the black and white closer together in the middle-ish area. Once that's sorted you can run the second script.
